This Biquadris game allows up to two players that compete against each other.

Unlike Tetris, Biquadris has no time limits, unless a player is in a higher level.

This version also allows players to define 'macro' commands, where they first give a name to their sequence of commands. Afterwards, they may enter a list of commands.

IMPORTANT: When trying to define a macro set of commands for future use, make sure that commands are written fully instead of in some abbreviated form, and that their multipliers are pre-pended to their associated, if any.

We allow players to obtain multiple special actions in one turn to impose onto their opponent depending on the number of rows cleared.

We hope you enjoy the game!
